**Entrepreneurship[(poem)](https://sagungarg.com/0-poem) for me is multiple hats in one Go: Selling to stakeholders, Resource mobilization & Skewed skills (Polyglot: Programmer in 7+ languages, System Architect, Engineering Manager, Product Owner, Product Manager & DevOps Expert).**

- 🗣 **Brief**: Currently serving as Global Innovation Director - Technology & Engineering at Bank Julius Baer. In my past life I have been a [repeat](https://sagungarg.com/1-previous-startups) Founder/CTO with 3 x startups [DevTool, CareerTech, PropTech] built with AI/ML to craft data products specially in architectures that are characterised by time-series, textual, geospatial, bigdata, nosql & erratic nature of data.

- ⏱ **CTO-on-Hire x 2**: I have proven ability to turn around AI/ML ventures in CTO-on-Hire capacity. I recently have a track record for two Pre-Series A Startups in Singapore(Supply Chain - Predictive Data Intelligence) and Hong Kong(Ed-Tech - Natural Language Generation Authoring) by stepping in shoes of outgoing Co-Founder/CTO in both ventures respectively to help the Co-Founder/CEO 
  - close Pre-Series A round, 
  - scale prototype to production grade usable product with live users/customers serving fortune 500 customers and 
  - managing engineering teams of 10+ team members. Both startup turn arounds involved managing product strategy, product features, engineering technical debt removal, hiring, devops & technical budgets. It approximately took me 18 months to turn the ship with a lot of support from the team I inherited in these ventures.
