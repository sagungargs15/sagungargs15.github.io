## [About](https://sagungarg.com/about) my expertise: CTO/Founder: [Sagun](https://x.com/sagungarg). You can also find me on linkedin [Sagun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagungarg)

**Entrepreneurship[(poem)](https://sagungarg.com/0-poem) for me is a self discovery of a polymath within you while you solve a problem creating something: Along the way you sell value to stakeholders, you enagage in resource mobilization & cultivate skewed skills (Polyglot: Programmer in 9+ languages, System Architect, Engineering Manager, Product Owner, Product Manager & DevOps Expert) to deliver a vision inspite of the constraints.**

- üó£ **Brief**: Currently serving as Global Innovation Director - Software Engineering & Enterprise Architecture at [Bank Julius Baer](https://www.juliusbaer.com/). In my past life I have been a [repeat](https://sagungarg.com/1-previous-startups) Founder/CTO with 3 x startups [DevTools, CareerTech, PropTech] built with AI/ML to craft data products specially in architectures that are characterised by time-series, textual, geospatial, bigdata, nosql & erratic nature of data. I have also played couple of stints of CTO-on-Hire to turn around two(2) pre-Series A startups in Singapore & Hong Kong respectively.
