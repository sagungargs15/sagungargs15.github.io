This repository is representing the source code of my private website https://sagungarg.com that is hosted with GitHub Pages. The website is powered by Jekyll and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It is inspired from  multiple themes and source codes
    - [Minimalist](https://github.com/BDHU/minimalist). 
    - [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project. 
    
    <!-- ![Demo of Minimalist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BDHU/minimalist/main/minimalist.png) -->


This project on purpose does not provide a license. That means it is under my exclusive copyright.
The reason for that being that 99% of this repo is private data of myself.

Therefore I would recommend to use [Jonathan McGlone’s](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/) project as a starter, since it doesn't contain any private information and the author allows copying without restrictions.
